<h3>Read the text</h3>
<p>One day, when Krishna was playing with His friends on the banks of the Yamuna river, 
    the boys and cows became thirsty, so they drank some water from the Yamuna. 
    Suddenly, they fell down on the ground. The river, as it turned out, was poisonous because serpent Kalia lived in the water.
     Krishna knew about Kalia. When He looked at His friends, they came round. He decided to get rid of Kalia. 
     So He climbed a big kadamba tree and jumped into the water. Kalia came to the noise and attacked Krishna. 
     All the boys and cows became terrified. </p>
     <p>Meanwhile in Vrindavana, people felt that something was wrong. They knew that Krishna’s elder brother Balarama wasn’t with Him today. 
        They wanted to make sure that everything was OK, so they immediately left the village and came to the banks of the river Yamuna. 
        When they arrived, they saw that a big black many-headed serpent was holding their dear Krishna in his tail. 
        Krishna’s mother Yashoda wanted to save her son and jump into the river but Balarama stopped her. </p>
<p>Krishna saw that everyone was really worried. So He freed Himself. Kalia was angry. 
    He tried to bite Krishna but couldn’t. He tried again and again but Krishna moved too quickly. 
    Soon Kalia became exhausted. Krishna noticed this and jumped up on Kalia’s head and began to dance. 
    He jumped from one head to another. Kalia was so tired that he almost died. 
    But then Kalia’s wives began to pray to Krishna, “Please, don’t kill him. Show him some mercy.” 
    Krishna listened to them and agreed not to kill Kalia. But He told Kalia to leave the Yamuna. 
    Kalia was afraid to go to the ocean because Garuda, the king of birds, could attack him. 
    But Krishna told him “You have my footprints on your heads. Garuda will not attack you.” 
    Finally, Kalia and his wives left the Yamuna river. All the people, who were still standing on the banks of the river, cheered. 
    Their Krishna was safe now.</p>
